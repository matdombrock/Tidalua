# üåä Wavescript üåä
An experimental synthesizer that uses Lua scripts to generate sound in a "live coding" environment.

What is it?
- A modular synthesizer
- A tracker
- A live coding environment
- A fun programming toy

What isn't it?
- A full featured DAW
- A "professional" synthesizer
- A traditional tracker
- A "serious" audio tool
- Lab equipment

### Scripting Example
```lua
-- Set the waveform for the first voice to square
wave(2, 1)
-- Play a note
note("C4", 1)
-- Create an LFO that oscillates between -1 and 1 every second
local lfo = math.sin(seconds * 2)
-- Set the pan of the first voice to the LFO value
pan(lfo, 1)
-- We can use the same LFO again to detune the oscillator
-- Set the detune of the first voice to the LFO value divided by 2
detune(lfo / 2, 1)
```

# OS Support
- ‚úÖ Linux
- ‚úÖ MacOS
- ‚ùì Windows 

# Building
## External Build Dependencies
- `curl`
- `tar`
- `make`
- `cmake`
- `clang` or `gcc`

## First Build
Initialize the build environment. This script downloads and sets up the necessary dependencies and builds the project.
```bash
./init.sh
```

Once the project has been initialized you can rebuild it with:
```bash
./build.sh
```

The binary and scripts will be placed in the `./out` directory.

# Running
```bash
./wavescript <script_path>.lua [ v | d ]
```
Example:
```bash
./wavescript ./scripts/example1.lua
```

- `v` - Visualizer mode (very experimental and slow)
- `d` - Debug mode

# Scripting
- There are 8 oscillators total.
- Only the first oscillator is enabled by default.
    - Use `enable(oscillator_number)` to enable others.
- Oscillator numbers start at 1.
  - Lua indexes start at 1 in general.
- Most functions that take an `oscillator_numer` param will default to 1 if not provided.
- Lua scripts are run in full before the any samples are generated
    - This means whatever the last state the script leaves the synth in is what will be heard.
- Scripts are run periodically as the synth is running (once per tick).
- Scripts will "hot reload" as the synth is running. Providing a "live coding" environment.
- Scripts are run in the context of the synth. 
    - This means that you can access the synth's state and functions.
- Use the `tick` or `seconds` globals to track time. 
    - This is the basis for creating time based effect.

## Lua API Globals

### `seconds`
The number of seconds that have passed since the synth started.

### `tick`
The current tick number. This is the basis for creating time based effects.

By default, there are 128 ticks per second. See `speed()` for info about changing this. 

## Lua API Functions
### `dbg(message)`
Prints a message to the console if the console output mode is set to debug.

```lua
-- Prints "Hello, world!" to the console if the console output mode is set to debug
dbg("Hello, world!")
```

### `enable(oscillator_number)`
Enables an oscillator. The first oscillator is enabled by default.

```lua
-- Enable the second oscillator
enable(2)
```

### `disable(oscillator_number)`
Disables an oscillator.

```Lua
-- Disable the first oscillator
disable(1)
```

### `freq(frequency, oscillator_number)`
Sets the frequency of an oscillator in Hz.

```lua
-- Set the frequency of the first oscillator to 440 Hz
freq(440, 1)
```

Range: `0.0 -> 22050.0`

### `note(note, oscillator_number)`
Sets the frequency of an oscillator to a given note name.

```lua
-- Set the frequency of the first oscillator to A4
note("A4", 1)
```

Range: `C0 -> C17`

### `note_midi(midi_note_number, oscillator_number)`
Sets the frequency of an oscillator to a given MIDI note number.

```Lua
-- Set the frequency of the first oscillator to MIDI note 69 (A4)
note_midi(69, 1)
```

### `detune(cents, oscillator_number)`
Sets the detune of an oscillator as a factor of the frequency.

```Lua
-- Detune the first oscillator by 50%
detune(0.5, 1)
```

### `amp(amplitude, oscillator_number)`
Sets the amplitude of an oscillator.

This is independent of the master volume and amplitude envelopes.

```lua
-- Set the amplitude of the first oscillator to 0.5
amp(0.5, 1)
```

Range: `0.0 -> 1.0`

### `env(attack, sustain, release, oscillator_number)`
Sets the attack, sustain and release of an oscillator for use in an amplitude envelope.

Measured in ticks.

The amplitude envelope is applied as a factor of the amplitude set with `amp()`.

By default, an oscillator does not use an amplitude envelope at all.

The amplitude envelope will be applied to the oscillator only after it's been enabled by the `env` function.

For an amplitude envelope to work, the note must be triggered only once then allowed to play out.

The envelope position is reset every time the note is triggered.

This means that we need to make sure the total length of the envelope is less than the total length of the note.

```lua
wave(3, 1)
-- Set the attack, sustain and release of the first oscillator to 8, 64, 128 ticks
env(8, 64, 128, 1)
-- The total length of this envelope is 200 ticks
-- Play it every 256 ticks to allow it to play out
if tick % 256 == 1 then
  note("C4", 1)
end
```

### `wave(waveform_number, oscillator_number)`
Sets the waveform of an oscillator.
```
-- waveform_number
-- 0 = Off      1 = Sine
-- 2 = Square   3 = Sawtooth
-- 4 = Triangle 5 = Noise
```

```lua
-- Set the waveform of the first oscillator to Square
wave(2, 1)
```

### `pan(pan, oscillator_number)`
Sets the pan of an oscillator.

A value of -1 is full left, 0 is center, and 1 is full right.

```lua
-- Set the pan of the first oscillator to full left
pan(-1, 1)
```

### `solo(oscillator_number)`
Sets an oscillator to solo mode. Only the soloed oscillator will be heard.

This is mostly used for debugging scripts. There is no easy way to "un-solo" an oscillator.

```lua
-- Solo the first oscillator
solo(1)
```

### `lowpass(cutoff, resonance, oscillator_number)`
Sets the lowpass filter of an oscillator.

```lua
-- Set the lowpass filter of the first oscillator_number
lowpass(1000, 0.5, 1)
```

### `highpass(cutoff, resonance, oscillator_number)`
Sets the highpass filter of an oscillator.

```lua
-- Set the highpass filter of the first oscillator_number
highpass(1000, 0.5, 1)
```

### `speed(speed)`
Sets the speed of the script in ticks per second.

For example setting the tick speed to `0.5` would result in 64 ticks per second.

It is not possible to increase the tick speed. However, 128 ticks per second is very fast (nearly audio rate).

The Lua script is run once per tick. Lowering the tick speed also means that the Lua script will be run less frequently.

```lua
-- Set the tick speed to 0.5
speed(0.5)
```

### `bus_lowpass(cutoff, resonance)`
Sets the lowpass filter of the master bus.

```lua
-- Set the lowpass filter of the master bus
bus_lowpass(1000, 0.5)
```

### Examples
See the `scripts` directory for examples.
